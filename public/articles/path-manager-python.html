        <p>
          one of the biggest pains when building systems for geoprocessing tools
          is that of managing the various inputs and outputs.
        </p>

        <p>
          this may seem like a trivial matter, just use:
          <pre>os.path.join</pre> right?
        </p>

        <p>
          if only it were that simple. having <code class="inline-code">os.path.join</code> littered throughout code is ugly
          and doesn&apos;t lend itself to a paradigm or a single interface to access paths.
