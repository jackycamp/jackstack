          <span style="font-style: italic">The Man in the High Castle</span>
          is comprised of four interleaving sub plots. It presents us with a
          glimpse of what life might be like if the Allies lost World War II; in
          this reality Germany occupies much of the eastern United States and
          Japanese the west.
        </p>

        <p>In no particular order, we get to know:</p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 600">Richard Childan</span> a scheming and
          racially frustrated white businessman who owns American Artistic
          Handcrafts Inc.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 600">Nobusuke Tagomi</span> a Japanese
          bureaucrat and buddhist.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 600">Frank Frink</span> a Jewish factory
          worker.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 600">Juliana Frink</span> Frank&apos;s
          ex-wife and judo instructor living in Colorado.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 600">Mr. Baynes</span> a man hidden under
          layers of secrets, is disguised as a Swedish gentleman, true identity
          is Rudolph Wegener, a member of a German political organization
          wishing to hault Nazi takeover.
        </p>

        <p>
          Naturally, as a piece from PKD, the barriers between reader and
          character seem to lose their meaning. The sense of reality and truth
          is simply a plaything for PKD; as if he wished the reader to become as
          mad as he was.
        </p>

        <p>
          This slipping of reality is a common theme among the sub plots. Frank
          Frink loses his job, jailed away and headed for extermination due to
          his race, and then released as if nothing happened. Mr. Tagomi (a
          pascifist) is driven mad after killing two German officers with his
          American Colt .44 pistol; he attempts to awaken a piece of jewelry and
          is momentarily transported to another reality where the Allies won the
          war (our reality?). Juliana realizes and accepts the Allies did in
          fact win the war after meeting with the author of The Grasshopper Lies
          Heavy, proving her existence and reality is fictional.
        </p>

        <p>
          The author does not do this subtly, he is upfront; taunting if you
          will. The book within this book, The Grasshopper Lies Heavy is
          mentioned in almost all story lines. At first glance, perhaps this
          phrase signals that such an incomprehensible reality exists where a
          grasshopper is heavy.
        </p>

        <p>
          But looking deeper, the phrase The Grasshopper Lies Heavy is derived
          from an excerpt in the bible, Ecclesiastes 12:5. From the King James
          version it reads: &quot;Also when they shall be afraid of that which
          is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall
          flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall
          fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about
          the streets.&quot;
        </p>

        <p>
          In summary, everything leads to death. Quite nihilistic if you ask me.
          But the point here is, did PKD want the reader to dig deeper into the
          meaning of this phrase? Is PKD taunting the reader? One wishes to find
          meaning in this phrase, as one wishes to find meaning in life, but any
          meaning you find will ultimately lead to death.
        </p>

        <p>
          Which reveals our next topic: human&apos;s desparation of control for
          one&apos;s reality and the strive for the comprehensible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although revealed by this meta cycle PKD puts the reader through, the
          characters also find themselves grasping for answers; wishing for
          something to lead them to meaning or point them in the right
          direction.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the possession of most of the characters is the I Ching, the
          Chinese &quot;Book of Changes.&quot; Throughout the story, characters
          consult the I Ching as an oracle, in that they ask it questions in
          search for answers and directions; particularly when they&apos;ve met
          a cross-roads or non-trivial decision to be made. Perhaps the author
          is also narrating on the laziness of human beings.
        </p>

        <p>
          Frank uses the I Ching to determine whether or not to begin a business
          venture. Mr. Tagomi uses the I Ching (?), Juliana uses the I Ching
          (when ?). who else uses the I Ching ?
        </p>

        <p>
          The author does not provide such answers as the reader searches for
          meaning but one event in the story leads me to believe that there is a
          way to cope with one&apos;s reality.
