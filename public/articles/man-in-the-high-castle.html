          In a reality where the Allies lost World War II, we peek into the
          lives of a few characters and catch a glimpse of a German and Japanese
          ruled society; the Germans occupying much of the eastern United States
          and Japanese the west.
        </p>

        <p>
          First we are introduced to
          <span style="font-weight: bolder">Richard Childan</span>, who owns and
          runs the day-to-day of American Artistic Handcrafts Inc. a store
          dedicated to American "collectables" of which there seems to be a
          rather hot market for post WWII. Mr. Childan is your classic monetary
          obsessed (nickel-and-dime-you) sort of businessman.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mr. Childan is anxiously waiting for an item to arrive of which a
          client of his is expecting;
          <span style="font-weight: bolder">Nobusuke Tagomi</span>. Mr. Tagomi
          is a bureaucrat at the
          <span style="font-style: italic">Ranking Trade Mission</span> in San
          Francisco, where he is a trade representative for the Japanese
          government. Mr. Tagomi is anticipating the arrival and meeting of his
          own client and wishes to procure a gift for him.
        </p>

        <p>
          We pivot to <span style="font-weight: bolder">Frank Frink</span>, a
          factory worker, laying in bed mulling over his actions at work the day
          before that got him fired. He realizes his career is inevitably over
          since the industry will &quot;blacklist&quot; him and he is Jewish. In
          the midst of his existential crisis, he decides to consult the
          <span style="font-style: italic">I Ching</span>
          in order to figure out how to mend the relationship with his boss. But
          he also asks it about his ex-wife.
        </p>

        <p>
          Skipping slightly ahead, we meet
          <span style="font-weight: bolder">Juliana Frink</span>, who is gazing
          at the sunset sky, waving, almost maliciously, at a Nazi transport
          rocket destined west. She lives in Colorado; a judo instructor.
          Juliana is a seemingly strong and independent woman but wanders her
          own life in search of answers.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: bolder">Mr. Baynes</span>, a Swedish
          gentleman, is on board a Nazi transport rocket (perhaps the one
          Juliana was waving to) headed to San Francisco. As the rocket starts
          its descent, Mr. Baynes converses with a young German man clearly
          revealing his distaste towards Germans. Mr. Tagomi greets Mr. Baynes
          when he lands and presents him with a 1938 Mickey Mouse wrist watch.
        </p>

        <p>
          After being fired, one of his coworkers Ed McCarthy (and the I Ching)
          convinces Frank to start their own business
          <span style="font-style: italic">EDFRANK Custom Jewelers</span>. After
          two weeks they produce their first batch. Frank and Ed make their
          first selling attempt to Mr. Childan. Ed attempts the sell alone as
          earlier Frank went into the shop under a guise and reveals that
          Childan is selling non-authentic items. After some tactful
          manipulation on Childan&apos;s part and awkward salesmanship on
          Ed&apos;s, Childan convinces Ed to leave the items on consignment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some time passes, Frank and Ed fail to sell any products causing Frank
          to become doubtful of the venture. Frank wants to quit, Ed tries to
          convince him otherwise. After their dispute, Frank steps out for a
          cigarette, signaling defeat. A plain clothes police officer approaches
          Frank, presents documentation, reveals that Frank is a Jew, and
          utlimately arrests him. One of the police officers explains they will
          hold him for the German Consul to try him under German Law.
        </p>

        <p>
          Later, due to Mr. Tagomi intervening (unbeknown to Frank), Frank is
          released from jail. Frank is in disbelief as he expected to be sent
          for extermination. Puzzled and on a completely different path than
          expected, he contemplates what to do next. Without consulting the I
          Ching, he rushes back to the shop, where Ed is having dinner. After a
          brief greeting back into the comprehensible, Frank lays down his coat,
          picks up some unfinished silver pieces, and continues his work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mr. Baynes informs Mr. Tagomi of a third party who will join their
          meeting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mr. Baynes anxiously awaits the third party to show up in order to for
          the meeting to take place.
