        <p>
          systems around geo-processing tools and spatial algorithms often deal
          with a significant number of files on disk; and if you tile or distribute parts
          of said system the number of files grow exponentially.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
          this is an inherent pain especially in the consulting space where 
          client deliverables are primarily rasters and csv&apos;s.
        </p> -->

        <p>
          it is challenging to know which files
          are inputs or outputs for the pieces in the system. decent documentation doesn&apos;t
          solve this problem either as it is too separate from the code.
        </p>

        <p>
          some pieces of the system consume the same inputs; the outputs of some pieces may be
          inputs to some other pieces. as the number of processing modules in a system increases
          and the number of inputs increases, this becomes messy, frustrating, and inefficient
          if your team doesn&apos;t have a standard.
        </p>

        <p>
          for some of our spatial data processing pipelines (written in python),
          my team agreed we should establish a single entry point
          and solid interface for all files the system might
          consume or produce.
        </p>

        <p>we came up with a list of requirements for a <code class="inline-code">PathManager</code>:</p>

        <p>1. should be able to hit dot and see all of the files for that instance</p>
        <p>2. defining a file or path should be trivial</p>
        <p>3. needs to support nested directories</p>
        <p>4. always takes care of <code class="inline-code">os.path.join</code> for us</p>
