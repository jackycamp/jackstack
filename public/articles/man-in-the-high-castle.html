          is comprised of four interleaving sub plots. It presents us with a
          glimpse of what life might be like if the Allies lost World War II; in
          this reality Germany occupies much of the eastern United States and
          Japanese the west.

        <p>
          In a reality where the Allies lost WWII, Germany occupies much of the
          eastern United States and Japanese the west; most of the storyline
          occurs in San Francisco, California.
        </p>

        <p>In no particular order, we get to know:</p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 600">Robert Childan</span> a scheming and
          racially frustrated white businessman who owns American Artistic
          Handcrafts Inc.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 600">Nobusuke Tagomi</span> a Japanese
          bureaucrat and buddhist.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 600">Frank Frink</span> a Jewish factory
          worker/laborer.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 600">Juliana Frink</span> Frank&apos;s
          ex-wife. A judo instructor living in Colorado.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 600">Mr. Baynes</span> disguised as a
          Swedish gentleman. His true identity is Rudolph Wegener, a member of a
          German political organization wishing to halt Nazi takeover.
        </p>

        <p>
          Naturally, as a piece from PKD, the barriers between reader and
          character blend together. Reality and truth are playthings for PKD; as
          if he wished the reader to become as mad as he was.
        </p>

        <p>
          The blur of reality touches all characters in the piece. Frank Frink
          loses his job, is jailed away and headed for extermination due to his
          race, and then released as if nothing happened. Mr. Tagomi (a
          pacifist) is driven mad after killing two German officers; he attempts
          to awaken a piece of jewelry and is momentarily transported to another
          reality where the Allies won the war (our reality?). Juliana realizes
          and accepts the Allies did in fact win the war after meeting with the
          author of
          <span style="font-style: italic">The Grasshopper Lies Heavy</span>,
          proving her existence and reality is fictional.
        </p>

        <p>
          The author does not do this subtly, he is upfront. Taunting. There is
          a book within the storyline,
          <span style="font-style: italic">The Grasshopper Lies Heavy</span>.
          Grasshopper portrays a reality where the Allies won WWII. Without
          getting too much into this mind fuck, the Grasshopper&apos;s existence
          completely distorts the reader&apos;s sense of reality. The reader
          lives in a reality where the Allies won WWII but is reading a book
          where the Allies lost WWII but within that book there is another book
          where the Allies won WWII. It&apos;s all blurred. Nothing clear.
          Nothing true. All true. I can hear PKD laughing as I write this.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, consider the title of this book. At first glance, the phrase
          &quot;The Grasshopper Lies Heavy&quot; may be a cryptic way of saying:
          an incomprehensible reality exists where a grasshopper is heavy.
        </p>

        <p>
          But looking deeper, the phrase &quot;The Grasshopper Lies Heavy&quot;
          is derived from an excerpt in the bible, Ecclesiastes 12:5. From the
          King James version it reads: &quot;Also when they shall be afraid of
          that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree
          shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire
          shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go
          about the streets.&quot;
        </p>

        <p>
          In summary, everything leads to death. Quite nihilistic if you ask me.
          But the point here is, did PKD want the reader to dig deeper into the
          meaning of this phrase? Is PKD taunting the reader? One wishes to find
          meaning in this phrase, as one wishes to find meaning in life, but any
          meaning you find will ultimately lead to death. PKD laughs again.
        </p>

        <p>
          PKD&apos;s taunting reveals our next topic: human&apos;s desperation
          of control for one&apos;s reality and the strive for the
          comprehensible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just as the reader wishes to understand and comprehend, naturally, the
          characters find themselves grasping for answers too; wishing for
          something to lead them to meaning or point them in the right
          direction.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the possession of most of the characters is the
          <span style="font-style: italic">I Ching</span>, the Chinese
          &quot;Book of Changes.&quot; Characters consult the
          <span style="font-style: italic">I Ching</span> as an oracle, in that
          they ask it questions in search for answers and direction;
          particularly when they&apos;ve met a cross-roads or non-trivial
          decision to be made. Perhaps this is a note on the laziness of
          individuals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Frank uses the <span style="font-style: italic">I Ching</span> to
          determine whether or not to begin a business venture. Mr. Tagomi
          consults the <span style="font-style: italic">I Ching</span> when he
          is apprehensive of upcoming appointments, Juliana carries around the
          <span style="font-style: italic">I Ching</span>, never letting it out
          of her sight. She says, &quot;it helps me decide.&quot;
        </p>

        <p>
          The author does not provide answers for the reader or the characters
          but one particular event in the story leads me to believe that there
          is a way to, for lack of a better term, cope with uncertainty.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of the goods that Mr. Childan swindles from Ed McCarthy, Childan
          attempts to gift Mrs. Betty Kasoura, a pin. As to not make the poor
          seduction attempt so obvious, he gifts the pin to Mr. Paul Kasoura to
          gift to Betty. However, Paul never gives the pin to his wife. He finds
          the pin dull and lifeless, so much so that he is amused by it. He
          shows it to some of his business acquaintances to get a laugh. Paul
          explains this to Childan.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet, Paul mentions, after several days of inspection of this inanimate
          blob he is rather emotionally fond of it. He explains the blob
          partakes in Tao, is at peace with the universe, and &quot;has
          wu&quot;. Profoundly, he says, the blob must have had wu flow into it
          by the hands of its creator (Frank Frink) and by studying the blob one
          gains wu as well. It is complete.
        </p>

        <p>
          Wu, 悟, context dependent, means to comprehend or realize. To have wu
          means to be enlightened; to be holy. One might be familiar with the
          monkey king from Chinese mythology, Sun Wukong 孙悟空.
        </p>

        <p>
          Frank Frink created this blob, poured his energy, soul, and wu into
          it, thereby releasing wu into his reality. Frank&apos;s story ends
          with him picking up where he left off: creating and perfecting.
        </p>

        <p>Perhaps that is one of the secrets.</p>

        <p>
          One can never be certain of their reality. One can never be in control
          of their perceived reality.
        </p>

        <p style="font-weight: 700">But one can create.</p>

        <p>
          One can control and comprehend those creations; even if it is just a
          distraction from uncertainty.
        </p>

        <p style="font-weight: 700">Creation gives way to certainty.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: 700">
          Creation gives way to the comprehensible.
        </p>
