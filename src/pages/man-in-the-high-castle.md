### PKD 1962
#### read june 2023 boston

In a reality where the Allies lost WWII, Germany occupies much of the
eastern United States and Japanese the west; most of the storyline
occurs in San Francisco, California.

In no particular order, we get to know:

__Robert Childan__ a scheming and racially frustrated white businessman who owns American Artistic Handcrafts Inc.

__Nobusuke Tagomi__ a Japanese bureaucrat and buddhist.


__Frank Frink__ a Jewish factory
worker/laborer.

__Juliana Frink__ Frank's ex-wife. A judo instructor living in Colorado.
        
__Mr. Baynes__ disguised as a Swedish gentleman. 
His true identity is Rudolph Wegener, a member of a
German political organization wishing to halt Nazi takeover.
                
The barriers between reader and character blend together. 
Reality and truth are playthings for PKD; as
if he wished the reader to become as mad as he was.

The blur of reality touches all characters in the piece. Frank Frink
loses his job, is jailed away and headed for extermination due to his
race, and then released as if nothing happened. Mr. Tagomi (a
pacifist) is driven mad after killing two German officers; he attempts
to awaken a piece of jewelry and is momentarily transported to another
reality where the Allies won the war (our reality?). Juliana realizes
and accepts the Allies did in fact win the war after meeting with the
author of The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, proving her existence and reality is fictional.

The author does not do this subtly, he is upfront. Taunting. There is
a book within the storyline, The Grasshopper Lies Heavy.
Grasshopper portrays a reality where the Allies won WWII. Without
getting too much into this mind fuck, the Grasshopper's existence
completely distorts the reader's sense of reality. The reader
lives in a reality where the Allies won WWII but is reading a book
where the Allies lost WWII but within that book there is another book
where the Allies won WWII. It's all blurred. Nothing clear.
Nothing true. All true. I can hear PKD laughing as I write this.

Now, consider the title of this book. At first glance, the phrase
"The Grasshopper Lies Heavy" may be a cryptic way of saying:
an incomprehensible reality exists where a grasshopper is heavy.

But looking deeper, the phrase "The Grasshopper Lies Heavy"
is derived from an excerpt in the bible, Ecclesiastes 12:5. From the
King James version it reads: 

"Also when they shall be afraid of
that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree
shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire
shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go
about the streets."

In summary, everything leads to death. Quite nihilistic if you ask me.
But the point here is, did PKD want the reader to dig deeper into the
meaning of this phrase? Is PKD taunting the reader? One wishes to find
meaning in this phrase, as one wishes to find meaning in life, but any
meaning you find will ultimately lead to death. PKD laughs again.

PKD's taunting reveals our next topic: human's desperation
of control for one's reality and the strive for the
comprehensible.

Just as the reader wishes to understand and comprehend, naturally, the
characters find themselves grasping for answers too; wishing for
something to lead them to meaning or point them in the right
direction.

In the possession of most of the characters is the
I Ching, the Chinese "Book of Changes". Characters consult the
I Ching as an oracle, in that
they ask it questions in search for answers and direction;
particularly when they've met a cross-roads or non-trivial
decision to be made. Perhaps this is a note on the laziness of
individuals.


Frank uses the I Ching to
determine whether or not to begin a business venture. Mr. Tagomi
consults the I Ching when he
is apprehensive of upcoming appointments, Juliana carries around the
I Ching, never letting it out of her sight. She says, it helps me decide.

The author does not provide answers for the reader or the characters
but one particular event in the story leads me to believe that there
is a way to, for lack of a better term, cope with uncertainty.

Of the goods that Mr. Childan swindles from Ed McCarthy, Childan
attempts to gift Mrs. Betty Kasoura, a pin. As to not make the poor
seduction attempt so obvious, he gifts the pin to Mr. Paul Kasoura to
gift to Betty. However, Paul never gives the pin to his wife. He finds
the pin dull and lifeless, so much so that he is amused by it. He
shows it to some of his business acquaintances to get a laugh. Paul
explains this to Childan.

Yet, Paul mentions, after several days of inspection of this inanimate
blob he is rather emotionally fond of it. He explains the blob
partakes in Tao, is at peace with the universe, and has
wu. Profoundly, he says, the blob must have had wu flow into it
by the hands of its creator (Frank Frink) and by studying the blob one
gains wu as well. It is complete.

Wu, 悟, context dependent, means to comprehend or realize. To have wu
means to be enlightened; to be holy. One might be familiar with the
monkey king from Chinese mythology, Sun Wukong 孙悟空.

Frank Frink created this blob, poured his energy, soul, and wu into
it, thereby releasing wu into his reality. Frank's story ends
with him picking up where he left off: creating and perfecting.


Perhaps that is one of the secrets.

One can never be certain of their reality. One can never be in control
of their perceived reality.
        
__But one can create.__

        
One can control and comprehend those creations; even if it is just a
distraction from uncertainty.
        

__Creation gives way to certainty.__

__Creation gives way to the comprehensible.__
