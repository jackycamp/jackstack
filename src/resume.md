I maintained a business-analytics data platform called Acho Studio; a one stop shop where users could
connect with their existing data sources, transform their data, and build dashboards and visualizations
that would ultimately be distributed either to the public or internally at their company.

I spearheaded support for collaboration across larger teams with the goal of increasing seat count.
I implemented full-stack logic enabling users to see where their coworkers were on the platform
and what transformations or operations they were performing on the data. With `socket.io` at the core of this
functionality, users could see their teammates' cursors flying across the screen in real-time! This was certainly a highly-marketable feature leading to a significant increase in engagement and DAU.

## PrimeLabs - Software Engineer

Oct 2019 - Nov 2021

I maintained a Mass-Spectrometry and Cheminformatics data platform called Prometheus. Prometheus was comprised
of a React front-end and a Ruby-on-Rails API; behind the scenes was postgresql application database, a whole suite of complex
distributed containerized bio and chem algorithms, and data-processing workers running on AWS EC2 instances.

TODO: discuss report generation

One of the big ticket items was automatic identification of clusters of mass-spec data called Envelopes. Based on
the sequence of Envelopes in a mass-spec run a user could identify compounds in their mixture. The current open-source SOTA algorithms
for this problem were slow or unweildy so I pioneered a computer vision training pipeline to help identify and group
these Envelopes.

TODO: discuss models used

The reporting functionality and innovative approach to compound identification was directly attributable to
increased interest by new clients in the platform.
