why is it critical in production systems

often overlooked, especially by juniors, I know I was certainly guilty of it.
Why do I need to log here? That's just additional LOC, sounds like bloat to me!

when debugging a problem in production, you're lucky if you can "replicate"
the problem. usually, all you have are logs

conclusion

this isn't anything new or profound. but it's helpful to be reminded.
