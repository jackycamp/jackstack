            In a reality where the Allies lost World War II, we peek into the lives
            of a few characters and catch a glimpse of a German and Japanese ruled society;
            the Germans occupying much of the eastern United States and Japanese the west.
          </p>

          <p>
            First we are introduced to <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Richard Childan</span>, 
            who owns and runs the day-to-day of American Artistic Handcrafts Inc. a store
            dedicated to American "collectables" of which there seems to be a rather hot market for post WWII.
            Mr. Childan is your classic monetary obsessed (nickel-and-dime-you) sort of businessman.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mr. Childan is anxiously waiting for an item to arrive of which a client of his is expecting;
            <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Nobusuke Tagomi</span>. Mr. Tagomi is a bureaucrat at the 
            <span style="font-style: italic;">Ranking Trade Mission</span> in San Francisco, 
            where he is a trade representative for the Japanese government. Mr. Tagomi is 
            anticipating the arrival and meeting of his own client, <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Mr. Baynes</span>, and wishes to procure
            a gift for him.
          </p>

          <p>
            We pivot to <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Frank Frink</span>, a factory worker, 
            laying in bed mulling over his actions at work the day before that got him fired. He realizes
            his career is inevitably over since the industry will &quot;blacklist&quot; him and he is Jewish.
            In the midst of his existential crisis, he decides to consult the <span style="font-style: italic;">I Ching</span>
            in order to figure out how to mend the relationship with his boss. But he also asks it about his ex-wife.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Skipping slightly ahead, we meet <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Juliana Frink</span>, 
            who is gazing at the sunset sky, waving, almost maliciously, at a Nazi transport 
            rocket destined west. She lives in Colorado and is a judo instructor. Juliana is a
            seemingly strong and independent woman but wanders her own life in search of answers.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Mr. Baynes</span>
