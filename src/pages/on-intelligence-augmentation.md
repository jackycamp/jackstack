# On Intelligence Augmentation

And the fascinations therein.

> This page is a work in progress.

- At times i've become frustrated by my ordinary mind. Why did i forget this thing or that? Am I destined to this fate forever?
- In a few decades, will i forget everything? Are my most treasured moments going to be lost? Perhaps this is the true death.
- How can Intelligence Augmentation help? Our minds are overloaded. Can int. aug. relieve some of this suffering?
- One of the top reasons I write on `jackstack` is because there's a lot of cool technical things i've encountered and books i've enjoyed reading -- I want to preserve. Am I subconciously afraid of losing it?
- Even if one lives moment to moment, ultimately present, things can still drift away.
- Some say, that life is but the sum of one's experiences. Is there anyway to preserve those experiences?
