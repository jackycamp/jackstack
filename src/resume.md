I maintained a Mass-Spectrometry and Cheminformatics data platform called Prometheus. Prometheus was comprised
of a React front-end and a Ruby-on-Rails API; behind the scenes was postgresql application database, a whole suite of complex
distributed containerized bio and chem algorithms, and data-processing workers running on AWS EC2 instances.

One of the big ticket items was automatic identification of clusters of mass-spec data called Envelopes. Based on
the sequence of Envelopes in a mass-spec run a user could identify compounds in their mixture. The current open-source SOTA algorithms
for this problem were slow or unweildy so I pioneered a computer vision training pipeline to help identify and group
these Envelopes.
