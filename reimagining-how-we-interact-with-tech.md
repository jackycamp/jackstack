statement: how we interact with devices/apps/computers is cumbersome and unnatural.
especially mobile computing.

aux statement: and how apple intelligence doesn't help either

The more I think about it, the more I realize how cumbersome and slow it feels interacting
with applications and computers -- especially mobile computing.

I've somewhat optimized my desktop computer usage experience through a primarily keyboard based approach (vim, alt-tabbing, single-monitor, etc.),
trying to stay away from apps or things that make you "point and click". But I'm not always at my desktop.

Humans tend to have other obligations, like putting dishes in the dishwasher, storing groceries when you get back from the store,

when you're on the go or in the middle of doing something that is when
your mobile device should be the MOST useful. But when you look at it objectively,
it's like hitting rock with stick.

Say I am preparing lunch, a swiss turkey sandwich on sourdough, pickles and tomato to top.
I should be able to say to my device, "Add 20 grams of protein for today".

i have an iphone 16 pro (recently upgraded from an 11 pro after the thunderbolt port died)
but i hate using it.

typing on this device is brutal.
the motions/typing can't keep up with my thoughts

i was so bullish on apple intelligence, surely i thought, apple intelligence would make this experience so much better.
got access to it, what a dud...

at the time of writing, apple int can barely add reminders, show your schedule, sometimes open apps, and... that's it.

I envision saying "Go to bear blog, list the most recent posts." Followed up with "Oh! Read that one to me."

Requests it should satisfy:
"Add 20g of protein to my consumption for today"

"Debrief me on voice memos from today"

"What are my total calories consumed today?"

"Show my weekly caloric intake"

"Show my weekly exercises today"

"Im planning a road trip, show me the route from Boston to Columbus OH"

"Debrief me on reminders i've set today"

"When I say, 'Debrief me today', give me a summary of number of reminders I've set, the number of voice memos created, and my caloric intake'"

"Save this paper for later"

"Show me all of the data that has been sent to apple"

"Go to bear-blog"

"Im planning a trip to Italy. Show me some cool spots"

"I'm feeling nervous for a work meeting this afternoon, help me calm down."
