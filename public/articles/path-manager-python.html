        <h1>Path Manager in Python</h1>
        <h3>june 2023 boston</h3>

        <p>
          at one of my places of employment we had various systems around
          geo-processing tools and spatial algorithms; often dealing with a
          ridiculous number of files on disk. we distributed some of these
          systems for performance reasons and saw the number of files grow
          exponentially.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          systems around geo-processing tools and spatial algorithms often deal
          with a significant number of files on disk; and if you tile or
          distribute parts of said system the number of files grow
          exponentially.
        </p> -->

        <!-- <p>
          this is an inherent pain especially in the consulting space where 
          client deliverables are primarily rasters and csv&apos;s.
        </p> -->

        <p>
          at the time, it was challenging to know which files were inputs or
          outputs for the pieces in the system. decent documentation didn&apos;t
          really help either as it was too separate from the code.

        <p>
          some pieces of said system consume the same inputs; the outputs of
          some pieces may be inputs to some other pieces. as the number of
          processing modules and number of inputs increased, this became messy,
          frustrating, and inefficient for our team.
        </p>

        <p>
          thus, for some of our spatial data processing pipelines (written in
          python), my team agreed we should establish a single entry point and
          solid interface for all files the system might consume or produce.
        </p>

        <p>
          we came up with a list of requirements for a
          <code class="inline-code">PathManager</code>:
        </p>

        <p>
          1. hit &quot;.&quot; and see all the files.
        </p>
        <p>2. defining a file or path should be trivial.</p>
        <p>3. needs to support nested directories.</p>
        <p>
          4. always takes care of
          <code class="inline-code">os.path.join</code> for us.
        </p>
        <p>5. documenting a path should be easy.</p>

        <p>
          i figured we should be able to define a subclass and instance like so:
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/jackycamp/04beed2eefb82ceba4856dd9832ed1b1.js"></script>

        <p>
          behind the scenes, when you access an attribute, the base class will detect
          whether or not the attribute is a file item, and return the value accordingly. 
        </p>

        <p>
          if the attribute is a file item, we will join the item&apos;s path with the root
          and return a path string, otherwise, business as usual; we don&apos;t wan&apos;t to conflict
          with any potential methods or non-file attributes defined in the base class
          or the subclass.
        </p>

        <p>
          originally, i went with a decorator approach, heavily inspired from python&apos;s
          <code class="inline-code">dataclass</code> implementation.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
          this implementation is relatively straight forward, 
        </p> -->
